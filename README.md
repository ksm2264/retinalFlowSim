# retinalFlowSim

Simulate retinal flow resulting from ground plane fixation given gaze in world angles, translation vector, and eye height

Just run 'accelerations.m' and modify parameters in there

Can also modify params in 'cam2camFlow' depending on desired pixel resolution / maximum eccentricity of visual angle
